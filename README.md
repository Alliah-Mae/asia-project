Youth Governance Analytics API

Overview
This API supports descriptive analytics for the Youth Governance System of the Municipality of San Jose, Batangas. It provides endpoints to retrieve summarized youth demographic data, survey attendance, program participation, and other indicators critical for local youth development planning.

The system empowers the Local Youth Development Office (LYDO) to make informed, data-driven decisions by offering aggregated insights from youth profiles and survey data.

Dataset Used
The API utilizes the Municipalityâ€™s youth governance database, which includes:

- Barangays list (barangays)

This dataset is structured to reflect the youth demographics, education, employment status, and participation in key youth governance activities.
