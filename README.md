Youth Governance 

Overview
This API delivers descriptive analytics for the Youth Governance System of the Municipality of San Jose, Batangas. It provides endpoints to retrieve summarized youth demographic data, survey attendance, program participation, and other key indicators essential for local youth development planning.

The system empowers the Local Youth Development Office (LYDO) to make informed, data-driven decisions by offering aggregated insights derived from youth profiles and survey data.

Dataset Used
The API leverages the Municipalityâ€™s youth governance database (ygs.sql), which comprises:

* List of barangays (barangays)
* Youth respondent profiles (respondents)
* Survey data (survey\_data) capturing youth participation, attendance, and program engagement

This dataset is designed to reflect youth demographics, educational attainment, employment status, and participation in core youth governance activities.
